## Features

The **AcuMate** extension for Visual Studio Code offers a range of powerful features for developers working with Acumatica, especially focused on TypeScript and HTML integration. These features enhance productivity, improve code accuracy, and streamline the development process for Acumatica's Modern UI.

### TypeScript Features

1. **IntelliSense Enhancements**  
   - Provides IntelliSense for available views within the Acumatica graph, helping users navigate and select relevant views.
   - Filters out service views, such as selector views or those containing `#Cache`, to ensure only essential views are shown.

2. **Terminal Commands**  
   - **Create Screen**: Easily create a new screen by specifying the screen name, graph, primary view, and the number of files to generate.
   - **Create Screen Extension**: Quickly create an extension for an existing screen by specifying the screen name, extension name, and optionally, a feature switch.
   - **Quick Application Build Commands**: Simplifies the build process by providing easy-to-use commands, reducing the need to remember multiple commands.

3. **Additional IntelliSense Suggestions**  
   - **Create View**: Simplifies view creation with options for naming, specifying whether itâ€™s single or a collection, and adding `viewInfo`, `graphConfig`, or `treeConfig` decorators.
   - **Create Field**: Allows quick creation of fields with options for field settings and relevant decorators.

4. **Snippets**  
   - **Event Hook Creation**: Quickly add event hooks to TypeScript code with built-in snippets.

### HTML Features

1. **HTML Validation Against TypeScript Code**  
   - Ensures HTML code aligns with TypeScript by validating:
     - Field names against the TypeScript code.
     - View names to confirm they are accurate according to the TypeScript definitions.
   - Integrates Acumatica-specific validation rules for ESLint, ensuring that code quality standards are met and enforced across both Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio.
